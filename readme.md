## Feedback
* Implemented solution in C#

### Limitations
* I would've liked to institute more robust checks at several points in the application.
* Should've implemented a generic FileHandler 
* Implementation assumes files would be present at a location, though it streams it.
* The final result is the same from both file types so a nice data structure to accomodate both polymorphically woulld've been nice.

### Usage
* Please ensure that the source data files are in a folder called "FeedData" in the same location as the compiled executable file and binaries. When running the code from the IDE, please ensure that the "FeedData" folder with the json and xml data files have heen copied to the \bin\Debug\netcoreapp2.0 folder

### Thanks!
* Thank you so much - I quite enjoyed the challenge.
